# Veterinarian Database

This database is created to model what a Vet’s database might be like. It has four main entities - staff, animal, appointment, and customer. This database is used by the staff to track appointments and record the animal patients as well as the customer information for future use. The database also includes various details of the staff for tracking of their specialty as well as for upper division usage regarding details such as pay. You would be able to find out the ssn, salary, and the specialty of the staff. With these, you would be able to track which staff worked on what animal. 

The database also contains last appointment time and date to determine if a customer has visited before or if they’re a new customer. Their animal companions have their reason of visit to include various results such as sickness, regular checkup, not feeling well and more. 


## Installation
Download all 3 files: 
	1. Vet-schema-v1.sql
	2. Vet-data-v1.sql
	3. Vet-queries.sql 

Run vet schema first, then vet data. That should load the four tables staff, animal, appointment, and customer. Then, run vet queries to get examples of how this database can be used.
